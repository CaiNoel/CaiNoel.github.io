						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I didn't know that white space is almost universally a multiple of eight pixels. At first, I thought that the amount of white space used was more arbitrary, but in hindsight it makes sense how the 'scale' of element padding would feel consistent. Additionally, the section on being aware of line spacing for text was also great to keep in mind – there's definitely a balance you need to strike between crowded and too open.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I really enjoyed the section that addresses concerns about white space 'putting off' users. This is a common concern that I hear when discussing UI with my friends, since they have a tendency to want to have as much information visible at all times, even at the cost of aesthetic. I was glad to see the article address this line of thinking and reiterate that users generally prefer a good balance of form and function.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"Think you’re using too much white space? There’s a good chance you’re not. If anything, you’re probably not using enough."</p>
						</li>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p>An 8 or a 9, I really enjoyed this article – especially how it used numerous examples of modern websites.</p>
