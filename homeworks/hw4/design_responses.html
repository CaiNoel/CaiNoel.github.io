						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I didn't know about the existence of accepted, preferred standards for web accessibility (for contrast, color, et cetera). I think it's incredible that there are – if not universal, at least widely available – such standards. The other section I didn't know much about before was the one on putting visual indicators around the section of the website the user is currently interacting with. I've always seen this in practice but not been sure if there was a greater reason for it.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite parts of all the articles we've been assigned are the sections that delve into specific tools and practices that we can implement into our workflow. Here, it's the inclusion of sites like Colorsafe so I can actually test how accessible my choices actually are without having to rely on my own distinction that may or may not work for everyone. Also, it seems like a great practice to create reference style guides for color as well.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"Accounting for accessibility early on in a product’s life cycle is best—it reduces the time and money you’ll spend to make your products accessible retroactively."</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p>8/10 – could've had a bit more detail on some more recommendations, but was overall really informative and useful!</p>
