    <h1>Cai Noël</h1>
    <em>Media Studies Major | 2nd year</em>

    <p>Hi, I'm Cai! I'm originally from Maui, and I spend most of my free time reading books and watching movies.
    Do not ask for my favorite of either because the answer is always changing. When I came to Berkeley, I actually
   intended to study Computer Science, but ended up changing my major. I also love going to the beach and writing (sometimes
   even both at the same time). From this class, I'm hoping to expand my knowledge of JavaScript and make a personal website for portfolio/general purposes :)</p>

    <h4>My favorite spots to grab food in Berkeley:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Trader Joe's (I cook 95% of the food I eat)</li>
      <li>Marugame Udon</li>
      <li>Imm Thai</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reading Responses:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>It was engaging to read about some of the techniques used to draw user attention towards specific features – the likes/retweets count, for example.
          It also make me curious about the sort of testing that companies such as AirBnB have to run in order to get a sense of whether, say, providing tabs for
          dates/guests actually drives usage.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed the GIFs of each app's user interface, deconstructed. It gave some insight into the thought process that goes into analyzing (and,
          subsequently, creating) UI and menus. It was interesting to see how the presence (or lack thereof) of specific elements changed how the eye naturally
          observes the app...what becomes the focal point, and what the app is trying to drive you towards.</li>
      <li><em>By routinely analyzing other apps, you’ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself.</em>
        <br>
          This really got me thinking about how to break down other user interfaces – UI is usually something we only notice when we're not supposed to – everybody knows when an
          interface sucks, but articulating what makes one work takes more practice. It's certainly something I'm going to pay more attention to when using apps.</li>
      <li>Probably an 8/10. My only criticism is that the article prompts a lot of questions about design intent ("why would they do <em>this</em>?") but I think it
          perhaps should've explored at least one <em>answer</em> to that. That might not be information the author has, however. Overall, a very solid article.</li>
