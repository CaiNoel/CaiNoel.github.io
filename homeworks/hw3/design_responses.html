					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I was surprised by the section about choosing different fonts for different demographics – obviously it should reflect your material/subject matter, but I didn't know that certain types were preferable for seniors, etc. The set of resources on finding fonts and font pairings were also quite useful, as it can be difficult to know which fonts work together without trying several combinations and intuiting it yourself. I checked out TypeWolf and will probably continue to use it in the future.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I really enjoyed the passages on constructing a style guide for your current project. Creating a consistent visual identity early on and applying those principles to your work is essential. You could even expand it from just typography to encompass general design principles for your specific site, such as information hierarchies.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Typography is all about experimentation. It’s both a science and an art. I challenge you to break out of your comfort zone and explore type in your design.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
